1-Simple - Simple master page with two editable areas
--------
Open master.html and read the "About this page" section on the top of the master.

2-Navigation - Multipage navigation example
--------
Open index.html and read "About this page".

3-Header - Different ways of handling complex elements
---------
Here we have a header with multiple elements that should be editable or optional. We show 3 different approaches, with different degrees of child pages customisation.

Open index.html and read "About this page".

4-PageMetaFields - Editable page title, description and keywords
------

Here, we took the navigation example and made page head information editable: title, page description and page keywords, so that every page can have different settings.

Open index.html and read "About this page".

5-LostEditableArea - Master pages with mismatched editable areas
-------

Here we explore what happens when master page and child page have different editable areas. Master page (index.html) has editable area with the id "content" and the child page (child.html) has an editable area with the id "main-content". Updating the child page will result in losing the current content of its editable area.

Open index.html and read "About this page".
